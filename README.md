    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client was a client that was looking to develop a web-based game to serve multiple platforms based on a current game of theirs that was currently only available for Android. 

    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I personally feel that what I did well in this documentation was considering the various design constraints and describing the UML diagram. 

    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
While the final project did not involve code, there were previous aspects earlier in the course of working with partially developed code and adding to it. Working through the UML diagram was essential in making sure the code was developed properly, such as making sure certain aspects were private versus public.

    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Probably parts of the Recommendations sections. Doing more research into various areas could add more detail into the document that would help the client.

    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It's important to consider the user's needs when designing as what someone as a developer might personally feel is best for parts of the coding design, the user might not desire in their final project. So having meetings and consulting with the user is a crucial part of planning and development.

    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Considering aspects of the UML diagram and careful planning of how code between classes interacted was the approach taken. In the future, first carefully analyzing any initial code is crucial to understanding how any code added to it will interact with the rest of the program.
