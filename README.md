-Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The Module Two Assignment was to create initial work on a software design template by completing the necessary sections of the template for the Executive Summary, Requirements, Design Constraints, and Rationale sections for a social media company deemed Chat Away.

-What did you do particularly well?

I personally feel I handled considering various constraints and describing the rationale as to why fairly well.

-Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Probably what was the most challenging to write was trying to consider what all of the restraints could be, and overcame this by trying to place myself in someone else's shoes and consider what might be needed.

-What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Some skills I feel I can take from this assignment is writing more for business purposes. I personally feel like I have writing essays fairly down well, but needed to improve upon writing more for other purposes better.
